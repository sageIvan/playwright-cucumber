```

### Advanced Testing Options

#### Run with UI Mode (Interactive):
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

#### Run tests in headed mode (see browser):
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

#### Run specific test by name:
```bash
npx playwright test --grep "navigation"
```

### Run All Tutorial Lessons:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/
```

### Run API Testing Only:
```bash
npx playwright test tests/0*-api-*.spec.ts
```

### Generate Test Reports:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## 📋 Understanding the Results

When you run a test, you'll see:

✅ **Green checkmarks** = Things that worked correctly  
❌ **Red X marks** = Things that failed (this is how you learn!)  
🎯 **Test names** = What each test is checking  

Example output:
```
Running 3 tests using 1 worker

  ✓ [chromium] › 01-basic-navigation.spec.ts:8:3 › Basic Navigation › should navigate to example.com (2.1s)
  ✓ [chromium] › 01-basic-navigation.spec.ts:15:3 › Basic Navigation › should have correct title (1.8s)
  ✓ [chromium] › 01-basic-navigation.spec.ts:22:3 › Basic Navigation › should contain example text (1.9s)

  3 passed (7.2s)
```

## 🎓 Learning Path Recommendations

### For Complete Beginners:
1. Start with `tests/00-quick-start.spec.ts` and `tests/01-basic-navigation.spec.ts`
2. Read the test files to understand what each test does
3. Run tests one lesson at a time in numerical order
4. Use `--headed` mode to see what's happening in the browser

### For People with Some Technical Background:
1. Run lessons 0-2 quickly to get familiar with Playwright syntax
2. Focus on lessons 3-5 for practical web testing skills
3. Dive into API testing with lessons 6-8
4. Study the test code to understand Playwright patterns

### For Developers Learning Playwright:
1. Study the test structure in each `.spec.ts` file
2. Understand the custom fixtures in `test-base.ts`
3. Explore global setup in `global-setup.ts` and `global-teardown.ts`
4. Try modifying existing tests and create your own test scenarios
